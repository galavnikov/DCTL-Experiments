# Welcome to the DCTL Color Grading Experimentation Folder!

This repository is a sandbox where you'll find various ideas, in-progress projects, and unfinished DCTL versions for DaVinci Resolve. Feel free to use these DCTLs for learning, testing, and free experimentation in your own color workflows.
